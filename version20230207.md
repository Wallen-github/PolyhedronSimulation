# version20230207

bug: this code could change the raw data in gen_sample.py and Computation.py.

tries: I tried to input my raw data before 'poly1 = rigidPolyhedron()' in line 51 of gen_sample.py. I also tried to input the raw data in BODIES.DAT in DATBOX directory.

The raw data and configuration which I want to create are shown in below

<table>
    <tr>
        <td ><center><img src="./version20230207/ResultPic/Rawdata.png" > </center></td>
        <td ><center><img src="./version20230207/ResultPic/RawConfig.jpeg" ></center></td>
    </tr>
</table>


But, the results got from LMGC90 code are

<table>
    <tr>
        <td ><center><img src="./version20230207/ResultPic/Pic1.png" > </center></td>
        <td ><center><img src="./version20230207/ResultPic/Pic2.png" ></center></td>
    </tr>
</table>


Comparing these results and raw data, we can find two considerable differences. 1. The shape of a concave polyhedron is revised. 2. The positions of two polyhedrons are changed too. 

In 'rigidContactor3D.py', some lines from 668 change the positions of vertices, but it can't explain the different values in BODIES.DAT. These lines compute the barycenter and inertial momentum matrix, and vertices positions are updated w.r.t the barycenter.
